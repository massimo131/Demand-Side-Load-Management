Description:

Manage load &amp; bills with Demand Side Load Management. Our algorithm shifts appliances to off-peak hours, cutting costs &amp; grid load. Get peak hour alerts &amp; control appliances via our app.

Demand Side Load Management is a technique which aims to minimize load on the power grid and reduce the consumer bills. Our real-time load scheduling algorithm shifts the shiftable appliances to off-peak hours. This not only reduces the consumption costs, but also the load on the power grid to avoid arbitrary load shedding.

We also send email notifications informing the start/end of peak hours and you can manage your appliances through our Mobile Application.
